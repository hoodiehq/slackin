# hoodie-slack

This is the source code of [hoodie-slackin.now.sh](https://hoodie-slackin.now.sh/).
It is based on [a fork of rauchg/slackin](https://github.com/szkl/slackin/tree/too-many-requests).
If [the pull request](https://github.com/rauchg/slackin/pull/303) is merged, please let us know so that we can use the main project :)

It would be great to setup continuous deployment to now via Travis. If you want
to help with that, please ping [@gr2m](http://github.com/gr2m).
